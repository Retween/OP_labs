A model Geminid meteoroid stream is considered. A 
fine-structured incident flux density profile and a profile 
for the mass index S obtained from observations are used to 
fit the model. The profile has two maxima of
very characteristic shape, and their origin is clearly 
visible from the model: branches of the stream have been 
formed due to differences in orbital parameters of 
particles ejected from the cometary nucleus before and 
after perihelion. So the structure of the Geminid shower 
swows the cometary origin of the stream. 

A preliminary estimations of the spatial density 
distribution of meteoroids far from the Earth orbit and
the stream mass are given. Influences of age, dust 
production rate, ejection velocity distribution are 
discussed. The orbits of the Geminid stream as well as 
the one of the asteroid (3200) Phaethon (the Geminid's
parent body) are located far inside the Jupiter's orbit.
The most realistic mechanism for the transformation of
initial comet's orbit to Geminid-type orbit is the reactive 
drag. The Geminid's structure agrees with this theory.
